Version: 1.0
Date: July 26, 2025

Abstract:
This paper proposes a system architecture for deploying and training very large language models (LLMs) on multi-socket, multi-core CPU servers. We address the primary challenge of CPU-based ML workloads—memory bandwidth and latency—by introducing a dual-strategy execution model for inference that dynamically switches between throughput-optimized token parallelism and latency-optimized tensor parallelism. For training, we detail a Data Parallelism architecture that leverages the vast memory capacity of CPU servers. By utilizing specific hardware features like Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA), Sub-NUMA Clustering (SNC), the Data Streaming Accelerator (DSA), and Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX), this architecture demonstrates a path to achieving practical latency and throughput targets at a fraction of the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of equivalent GPU-based solutions.
1. Introduction

The current landscape of Large Language Model (LLM) deployment is dominated by Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) due to their exceptional parallel processing capabilities. However, this dominance has created significant limitations for widespread enterprise adoption, including prohibitive costs, severe memory capacity constraints on individual devices, and persistent supply chain bottlenecks. This paper argues for a re-evaluation of commodity CPU servers for large-scale inference and fine-tuning. The advent of modern server CPUs with high-bandwidth DDR5 memory, massive core counts, and specialized on-chip accelerators presents a new opportunity. We propose an architecture designed from first principles to exploit these features, making CPUs a viable and economically strategic platform for massive AI models.
2. Strategic Context and Business Value

The objective of this architecture is not to match raw GPU FLOPs but to achieve practical latency and throughput targets with dramatically lower TCO and larger memory capacity.

This approach delivers key business value by:

    Enabling Massive Model Deployment & Training: A single dual-socket server can host and fine-tune a 250B+ parameter model in unified memory, a task that would require a costly and complex multi-node GPU cluster.

    Avoiding Procurement Bottlenecks: It leverages readily available commodity server hardware.

    Facilitating On-Premise & Private AI: It allows for deployment within an organization's own data center, ensuring data privacy and security for sensitive workloads.

3. Inference Engine Architecture

Inference is split into two distinct phases to optimize for two different goals: maximum throughput for the initial prompt, and minimum latency for subsequent token generation.
3.1. Phase 1: Prompt Processing (Throughput-Optimized)

    Strategy: Token Parallelism. The initial batch of N tokens is split across C cores.

    Data Flow & HPC Details: For most layers, cores are independent. For the Multi-Head Attention layer, an AllReduce operation synchronizes head outputs. The DSA can be used for on-the-fly memory reorganization to optimize this step. All memory is allocated with NUMA and SNC awareness.

3.2. Phase 2: Autoregressive Generation (Latency-Optimized)

    Strategy: Tensor Parallelism. The weight matrices are split into C slices, and each core processes one slice of the computation for the single token, synchronizing with an AllGather operation.

    Data Flow & HPC Details: This requires a pre-sharded weight layout.

3.3. The Critical Transition: Asynchronous Weight Reorganization via DSA

The memory layout for Phase 1 (contiguous) and Phase 2 (sliced) is different. This reorganization must not stall the pipeline.

    Solution: As Phase 1 completes, the engine offloads the memory re-layout task to the DSA. The DSA performs this massive copy/reformat operation in the background.

3.4. Computational Core & Data Streaming

The primary computational cost in each layer is matrix multiplication. The Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) for a standard matrix multiplication (C = A * B, where A is M×K and B is K×N) are calculated as:
MatMul_FLOPs=2timesMtimesKtimesN
This calculation forms the basis for our performance projections, with acceleration provided by AMX.

However, performance is ultimately gated by the ability to feed the computational units. The key is to hide DRAM latency by creating a continuous stream of data into the L3 cache, managed by the CPU's hardware prefetchers. A high-end dual-socket server with 12-channel DDR5-6400 can achieve a theoretical peak memory bandwidth of ~1.2 TB/s.

The viability of this streaming model can be demonstrated with a simple calculation. The time required to stream a small chunk of data (e.g., 1 MB) from DRAM to the L3 cache is:

Time = fractextDataSizetextBandwidth=frac1textMB1.2textTB/s=frac1times106textbytes1.2times1012textbytes/sapprox0.83textmicroseconds

A 4.0 GHz CPU executes 4,000 clock cycles in one microsecond. Therefore, the ~3,300 clock cycles required for this 1 MB data transfer is on a similar order of magnitude to main memory latency itself. This confirms that it is computationally feasible for hardware prefetchers to keep the pipeline full by streaming data in small, continuous chunks, effectively hiding the DRAM access latency behind ongoing computation.
4. Training Architecture: Data Parallelism

Training workloads are optimized for maximum throughput.

    Strategy: Data Parallelism

        Execution Model: A full model replica resides on each CPU socket. The global batch of training data is split, with each socket receiving its own independent mini-batch.

        Gradient Synchronization: After the backward pass, a single, highly optimized AllReduce operation is performed across all sockets to average the gradients.

        HPC Implementation Details: This approach minimizes inter-socket communication. Mixed-precision training is employed, using AMX for fast BF16 computation and maintaining a master copy of the weights in FP32 for stable optimizer updates.

7. Limitations and Future Work

This architecture presents a strong foundation, but further research is warranted.

    Synchronization Overhead: The latency overhead of the AllGather operation in Phase 2 could become a bottleneck at very large core counts. Future work will explore hierarchical or asynchronous gathering techniques.

    Further Optimizations: This design can be extended to incorporate Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) routing and advanced techniques like activation quantization to further reduce memory bandwidth pressure.

    Batching Strategies: Exploration of dynamic or continuous batching strategies for the autoregressive phase could improve overall system throughput in multi-user scenarios.

8. Robustness and Fallback Scenarios

    DSA Copy Lag: If the DSA reorganization is not complete, the engine can begin Phase 2 by having cores read directly from the original contiguous layout for any missing slices, ensuring graceful degradation.

    NUMA Misconfiguration: At startup, the engine will detect the system's NUMA/SNC topology and default to a simpler memory allocation scheme if not optimally configured, ensuring correctness.
